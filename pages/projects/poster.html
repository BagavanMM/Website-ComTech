                  Mental health awareness is something that not that many people focus on in our school, and because of that, 
                  a lot of people in our school don’t know how to deal with stress, anxiety, etc. That’s why I want to create a 
                  poster for Unionville High School that targets students so that we can all be aware of the struggles that 
                  people go through and how we can do something about it. By making my client UHS, I’ll be able to target my 
                  audience effectively. The final product is a poster that captures the feeling of stress and anxiety in an 
                  abstract way. This allows whoever is walking by to understand what the poster is trying to say without the 
                  need for that much text. Additionally, there would be text in this poster that shows you how you can cope 
                  with poor mental health. The main limitation with having a poster is that most of the information that you 
                  want to convey would need to be conveyed through art/images. Having more text would most likely lead to people
                  not spending time reading through what you have. This also means that you have to be intentional with what 
                  kind of links you’re adding to your poster (if you’re adding any), because if you have a long link most 
                  people probably won’t be searching it up. This final product will be pasted throughout the school on walls, 
                  pillars, etc., which will allow me to reach more students. The ultimate goal of creating this poster is to 
                  help spread awareness on this problem that affects a lot of people at school. This will not only help people 
                  understand that they are not alone, but also show us how we can help people who struggle with this problem.

                                          The main takeaway from this website is that so many more students are affected by mental health issues today than ever before, and that's led to an increase in substance use (even if it’s a medication) and unfortunately, more deaths.

              <p class="mt-0">After researching and planning out what kind of poster I wanted to make, it was time to sketch a couple of different ideas
                just to get a better sense of how I wanted to portray my message.</p>

                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">My creative solution</span> to address the stigma surrounding mental health and lack of awareness was to design a poster for high school students that <span style="font-weight: bold;">emphasises the importance of talking about one's struggles with mental health</span>. The use of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">C.R.A.P principles</span> enhanced my design by making it stand out, easily readable, and well-organised. I used <span style="font-weight: bold;">high contrast</span> in the background to make my poster pop out, <span style="font-weight: bold;">repetition</span> to emphasise specific points, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">alignment</span> to create unison and organisation. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Proximity</span> was also used to group text together and help with organisation. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Typography</span> was used to emphasise specific points on the poster, with font and font-size varying depending on what I wanted to emphasise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For my chosen <span style="font-weight: bold;">colour scheme</span>, I opted for a monochromatic <span style="font-weight: bold;">light green colour</span>, as green represents mental health as being quiet and restful. A monochromatic scheme was chosen to keep the design simple and straightforward, allowing for specific parts of the poster to be emphasised. My poster demonstrates <span style="font-weight: bold;">inclusivity</span> by showing that it's okay to express yourself and seek help, creating a welcoming environment for everyone, including those from diverse backgrounds. Although not specifically targeted towards technological education courses, the poster helps to create awareness that the community is inclusive and welcoming to all.

                    The image of a person curled up behind a door represents how people with mental health struggles feel, trapping their emotions and not expressing them to others. The accompanying text emphasises the <span style="font-weight: bold;">importance of talking to others about one's problems and the stigma surrounding mental health</span>. The phone number and hashtags provided encourage students to seek help and support. The design's message is clear and effective, communicating with the target audience by appealing to their emotions and addressing a relevant social justice theme. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cultural sensitivity</span> is included in the design, as mental health struggles can affect individuals from all backgrounds and cultures, and it's essential to create awareness and support for everyone.
