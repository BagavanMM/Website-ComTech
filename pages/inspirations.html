                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Pablo Picasso is one of my biggest inspirations because he was an artist who thought outside the box
                    and challenged the norms of his time. Even though he faced criticism for his unconventional style, I
                    think that he played a pretty big role in expanding the possibilities of what art could be.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                    His artwork was often met with mixed reactions, with some people dismissing it as mere scribbles or
                    simplistic creations - but, I find that his ability to take everyday objects and transform them into
                    something abstract is truly fascinating. His style also opened infinitely more interpretations to
                    what the artwork could represent, which is beautiful.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                    What I admire most about Picasso is his fearlessness in pushing boundaries and exploring new
                    artistic territory. He introduced styles like <span class="font-bold">Cubism</span> and <span
                        class="font-bold">Surrealism</span>, which shattered the conventional notions of perspective and
                    representation. By breaking down forms and rearranging them in unconventional ways, he challenged
                    viewers to question their perception of reality.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                    His art continues to inspire me to think outside the box and to strive for artistic authenticity.

                    Leonardo da Vinci is one of the most iconic figures in the history of art and science. His
                    multidisciplinary genius and insatiable curiosity continue to inspire me in countless ways.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                    As an artist, Leonardo's attention to detail and mastery of technique were unparalleled. His
                    paintings, such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, are renowned for their beauty and depth. He
                    captured the human form and expressions with such realism and emotion that they continue to
                    captivate audiences centuries later.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                    His scientific pursuits were equally remarkable. He
                    conducted groundbreaking studies in anatomy, engineering, and physics, among other disciplines. His
                    sketches and inventions, like the flying machine and the Vitruvian Man, demonstrate his visionary
                    approach and his belief in the harmony between art and science.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                    His ability to combine artistic expression with scientific inquiry is a
                    testament to the power of interdisciplinary thinking and the potential for limitless exploration.
